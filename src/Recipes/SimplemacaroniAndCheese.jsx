                            Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese dish. Fancy, designer mac and
                            cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so
                            many expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This
                            simple recipe is cheap and tasty.

                        <p>
                            Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente,
                            about 8 minutes.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Step2: Make a Roux</h3>
                        <p>
                            While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is
                            a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up
                            the base of this creamy mac and cheese. To make the roux, start by
                            melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and
                            pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the
                            mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Step 3: Add Cheese and Macaroni</h3>
                        <p>
                            Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar
                            cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese
                            because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well
                            as block cheese. Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir
                            into cheese sauce until coated. Can Yo

                    <p>
                        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni
                        in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm

                    <p>
                        You can never have enough cheese, and I usually add an extra 1/2 cup
                        without ruining the recipe.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Keep a careful eye on the milk when boiling, as milk boils fast and burns
                        easily. Burnt milk will show up in the recipe's flavor if overcooked.
