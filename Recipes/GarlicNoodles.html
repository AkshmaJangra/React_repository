        <h1>Garlic Noodles</h1>
        <div class="artical-post-header">
            <p>These garlic noodles are deceivingly simple, yet devastatingly delicious. Garlic noodles were invented
                back in the '70s at a restaurant in San Francisco called Thanh Long. Usually served with roasted
                Dungeness crab, the recipe is a very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of investigation, and
                even more experimentation, I think this is very close.</p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <div class="steps">
                <h3>Step1</h3>
                <p>Stir soy sauce, oyster sauce, Worcestershire sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne pepper
                    together in a small bowl for the secret sauce.</p>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1
                    minute. Quickly stir in the secret sauce and turn off the heat.</p>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring
                    occasionally, until tender yet slightly firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. </p>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>Transfer spaghetti into the sauce using tongs, bringing some of the cooking water with it. Toss until
                    well coated; stir in Parmesan cheese. Splash in more pasta water if noodles are too dry.</p>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p>Plate noodles; garnish with green onions and red pepper flakes.</p>

            <h2>Chef's Notes:</h2>
            <p>Virtually any noodle will shine in this, but I quite like good old spaghetti. Good options include
                Chinese egg noodles and ramen.</p>
            <p>Apparently, one of the secret ingredients is Maggi Seasoning Sauce, which I decided not to use since I'm
                not sure how easy it is for the average person to find. Besides, I think my assortment of savory,
                umami-rich substitutes did the job quite nicely, and everything in the ingredient list can be found at
                any large grocery store.</p>
